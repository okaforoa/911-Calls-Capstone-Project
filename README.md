# 911 Calls Exploration Project: Decoding Emergency Call Trends

Join me in my 911 Calls Exploration Project, where I dissect emergency call patterns using Python tools like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in a Jupyter notebook. With a dataset sourced from Kaggle, I'm focused on revealing insights through data analysis and dynamic visualizations.

My project revolves around exploring the temporal rhythms of 911 emergency calls. By scrutinizing timeframes, I aim to uncover the common incidents that trigger these calls. Come along as I decode these trends and enhance my data analysis skills.

## Tools:

- Jupyter notebook
- Python with NumPy and Pandas
- Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Real-world Kaggle dataset

## Goals:

- Analyze and visualize 911 call patterns over time.
- Identify key reasons behind emergency calls during different periods.

Let's embark on this journey to unravel the secrets within emergency call data.
